This Is Just To Say

fee fi fo fum


By William Carlos Williams

I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold

And we can admire Pushkin poems as well:
“Confess to me, what’s wrong. You’re in dejection.”
— I love, my friend! - “Which lady holds you captive?”
— She does. — “Glisera? Chloe? Lila’s so attractive!”
— O, no! — “To whom do you submit your soul’s affection?”
— To her! — “You’re humble! Why all this remorse?
Why do you seem so sorrowful and grim?
And who’s to blame? Her fiancé, her dad, of course...”
— It isn’t that! — “Then what?” — For her, I can’t be him.
